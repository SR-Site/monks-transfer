Because it's a relatively small group of people, many WAGS are close friends with one another. But there is a hierarchy within the group, as the wives who have husbands with multimillion-dollar contracts have all the power. This reality series follows several WAGS who are married to or dating professional athletes. Sasha Gates, who is married to a veteran professional football player, is the head of the group and has her own children's clothing line with best friend and fellow WAG Autumn Ajirotutu, who is also married to a pro football player. Barbie Blank is involved with a professional hockey player, but she is an athlete herself -- she used to be a pro wrestler under the name Kelly Kelly.",

					"Description": "Several years since a zombie virus swept across America, there's only one person -- who goes by just Murphy -- known to have survived the infection -- the world's last hope at creating a vaccine. The last functioning viral lab needs blood from him for its antibodies, but the facility is in California and the man is in New York. A ragtag group of strangers works to transport him to the West Coast, but his dark secret remains hidden, which could threaten everyone. Hammond and his second in command, Garnett, initially lead the group of the living -- later replaced by Lt. Warren -- and computer hacker Citizen Z helps everyone navigate through the zombie-infested terrain. When the group meets a man in Colorado, he offers to take Murphy the rest of the way to California. When nuclear weapons are launched, people head into survival mode and become desperate to find a cure.",
